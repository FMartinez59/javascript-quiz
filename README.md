# the-office-quiz

## This is a quiz dedicated to one of my all time favorite shows "The  Office". I wanted a make a quiz to practice using data states and multiple functions in JavaScript and one of the best ways is to make a Quiz. I learned a lot, mainly from data states and how I can use them to change screens depending on where the user is and where they want to go.
